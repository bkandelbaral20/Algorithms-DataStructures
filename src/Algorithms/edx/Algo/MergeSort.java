/*
In Merge Sort, we recursively split and sort the left half and the right half of an array; once they are sorted, we
combine them. The description is deceptively simple, the actual implementation and walking through of the algorithm
could take quite some time to fully grasp. Let's try to apply the algorithm to our array. First, we are told to sort
the left half and the right half of the array.

Here is the pseudocode:
                if the size of array < 2: // already sorted
                    return array
                else
                sort left subarray
                sort right subarray
                combine them
