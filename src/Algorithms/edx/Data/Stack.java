/*
A stack is a special kind of LinkedList. It generally only supports fast access to one side of the list as opposed to
both and does not allow for access or removal for elements that's not the top of the stack. A good way to picture a
stack is to imagine a stack of trays in a restaurant. We have "access" to the top of the stack and can pick up
 a tray(an element) from the top easily, but we can't do so at the bottom.
Stack is therefore called a LIFO(Last-in First-out) data structure. That is, the last element added to the stack
will be first element to be removed.

There are three essential stack operations:push, pop, peek. Pushing pushes a new element to the top of the stack;
popping removes and returns the top element from the stack; and finally, peeking returns the top element without
removing it from the stack. Here are some code in Java:

A stack is fairly easy to use and understand in Java. Note that push() takes an object, so we must convert an integer
primitive to an integer object before we pass it in.

public class Stack {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

//        creating a new stack object
//        Stack stack = new Stack();
//        stack.push(new Integer(3)); // [3]
//        stack.push(new Integer(5)); // [3,5]
//        System.out.println(stack.peek()); // prints 5
//        stack.push(new Integer(6)); // [3,5,6]
//        int x = stack.pop();
//        System.out.println(x); // prints 6
//        System.out.println(stack); // prints [3,5]
    }
